## Main functionality

- Implemented semantic layout with three breaks (for mobile devices from 380px,
  tablets from 780px, and desktop from 1200px)

- The application has the following routes '/' - the home page; '/tweets' - the
  page displaying tweets. The tweets page has a Back button that leads to the
  main page. If the user enters via a non-existent route, they will be
  redirected to the home page.

- When you click on the Follow button in a user's profile, you are added as a
  follower, and when you click again, you are removed. When the page reloads,
  the entered data is saved.

- The tweets page has a filter: show all - show all tweets follow - show tweets
  that have a follow status. followings - show tweets that have a following
  status
